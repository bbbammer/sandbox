# sandbox
sandbox project to grow django and webdev skills

This is a tutorial from the real python website, link below:
https://realpython.com/build-a-blog-from-scratch-django/

The project is easy enough to follow even for a beginner. But it also teaches about creating
comment boxes and this basic functionality will be a building block for allowing users to 
create profiles and add jobs to the site

I plan to use this template as a building block for the MVP of Greenhouse

I like the name but I'm open to develop a new one... maybe shorter and a word that doesn't have
its own meaning already
